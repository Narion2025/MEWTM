# 🔗 Dynamic Knot: Reactive Control Spiral
reactive_control_spiral:
  name: "Reactive Control Spiral"
  description: >
    A dynamic knot that emerges when self-worth disruptions (e.g. shame, guilt) can't be regulated and shift into covert control dynamics. 
    The person loses perceived autonomy and compensates through indirect, reactive influence. 
    This creates a spiral of ambivalence, empathy-activation, and power asymmetry – often unconsciously.

  activated_markers:
    - EMPATHY_DECOY_MARKER
    - ANTICIPATED_BEHAVIOUR_MANIPULATION
    - AMBIVALENT_MARKER
    - UNCLEAR_MARKER
    - SHAME_PROFILE
    - GUILT_MARKER

  trigger_sequence:
    - Self-worth collapse (e.g. through criticism or distance)
    - Internal helplessness activates shame or guilt
    - Ambiguity and ambivalence increase
    - Reactive control via manipulative strategies begins
    - Counterparty responds – often with comfort, avoidance, or escalation

  systemic_effect: >
    The relationship becomes opaque. One loses clarity of action, the other control. Communication turns indirect. 
    Connection is not built through presence, but through triggered reactions. Exhaustion or rupture often follows.

  integration_suggestion: >
    Build early detection: Once three markers from this knot appear together, initiate meta-communication. 
    Example: “I notice a pattern here. Let’s not react – let’s reflect.”
